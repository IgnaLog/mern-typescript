## ðŸ’» Quick start

### Backend - Server Directory

To deploy this project, you must first install the node_modules packages. To do this, open a console with the root path of the server directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

After that, make sure you have mongodb installed locally or in the cloud. Then, create an `.env` file in the main directory of the project with the following environment variables:

    PORT=<3000>
    MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME=<tsmern>
    MONGODB_HOST=<127.0.0.1>
    MONGODB_USER=<admin>
    MONGODB_PASSWORD=<admin>

Finally, in the terminal with the main path execute:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Frontend - Client Directory

As in the backend you need to load the node_modules from the client folder through the `npm install` command, finally run also `npm run dev` to launch the client application.
